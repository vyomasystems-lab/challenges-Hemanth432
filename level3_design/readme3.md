## Abstract
The 74181 chip is important because of its key role in
minicomputer history. Before the microprocessor era,
minicomputers built their processors from boards of
individual chips. A key part of the processor was the
arithmetic/logic unit (ALU), which performed
arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction) and
logical operations (AND, OR, XOR).The 74181
implements a 4-bit ALU providing 16 logic functions
and 16 arithmetic functions.This circuit is
implemented using verilog.

## Circuit Details
Texas Instruments introduced the 74181 Arithmetic /
Logic Unit (ALU) chip, which put a full 4-bit ALU on
one fast TTL chip. This chip provided 32 arithmetic
and logic functions, as well as carry lookahead for
high performance.The 74181 implements a 4-bit
ALU providing 16 logic functions and 16 arithmetic
functions. As well as the expected addition,
subtraction, and Boolean operations, there are
some bizarre functions such as "(A + B) PLUS
AB".So there are 2^4 = 16 possible functions.
Extend these to 4 bits, and these are exactly the 16
logic functions of the 74181, from trivial 0 and 1 to
expected logic like A AND B to contrived operations
like NOT A AND B. These 16 functions are selected
by the S0-S3 select inputs.The circuit diagram is
shown in Figure 1.The expected outputs or the truth
table is shown in Figure 2
